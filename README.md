This extension provides Python code intelligence on Sourcegraph. Ensure this extension is enabled and then try it on some examples:

-   Tensorflow: [tensorflow_ranking/examples/tf_ranking_libsvm.py](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/tensorflow/ranking@931e4e18d68612d0b29dc3c81994acdd4b6ab743/-/blob/tensorflow_ranking/examples/tf_ranking_libsvm.py#L294:27&tab=references)
-   Flask: [flask/views.py](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/pallets/flask/-/blob/flask/views.py)
-   Zulip: [corporate/lib/stripe.py](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/zulip/zulip/-/blob/corporate/lib/stripe.py)
-   Trivial sample: [pkg0/m0.py](http://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sgtest/python-sample-0/-/blob/pkg0/m0.py)

## Usage with private Sourcegraph instances

This extension is configured to talk to a language server over WebSockets. If you are running a
private Sourcegraph instance, you should run your own language server. The server is available as a
Docker image `sourcegraph/lang-python` from Docker Hub.

### ðŸš¨ Secure deployment ðŸš¨

We recommend deploying the language server behind an auth proxy or firewall and
treating it like an authenticated user because anyone that connects to the
language server can access resources such as private code that the language
server has access to.

Make sure you set `python.sourcegraphUrl` to the URL that the language
server should use to reach Sourcegraph, which is likely different from the URL
that end users use.

### Using Docker

1. Run the Python language server Docker container:

    ```sh
    docker run --rm -p 4288:4288 sourcegraph/lang-python:insiders
    ```

1. Enable this extension on your Sourcegraph  https://sourcegraph.example.com/extensions/sourcegraph/lang-python


1. Add these to your Sourcegraph settings:

    ```json
      "python.serverUrl": "ws://localhost:4288",
      "python.sourcegraphUrl": "http://host.docker.internal:7080",
    ```

    If you're running on Linux, change `python.sourcegraphUrl` to the IP given by:

    ```bash
    ip addr show docker0 | grep -Po 'inet \K[\d.]+'
    ```

## Known issues

-   Dependencies are not installed. Hovers, definitions, and references only work for sources checked into the single repository you are viewing.
-   Cross-repository definitions and references are not yet supported.
-   Hangs on very large repositories (e.g. django/django)
